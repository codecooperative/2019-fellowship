## Set up your User Guide

### What is a User Guide?

A User Guide is like a "How To" for a human being.

Here is Tolu's User Guide:

**Name:** Tolu

**Pronouns:** She/her/hers

**Astrological sign:**

**Favorite food:**

**Favorite song:**

**List your top 3 strengths:**

Deliberative, Individualization, Restorative.

**What I value**

Empathy, curiosity, and consideration. A clear prioritization of everyone’s best interests. A successful working partnership takes into account our humanity and that we might be in disparate emotional places at the start of an interaction. I value community and try to make sure people feel a foundational level of safety in whatever space we’re in together.

**What I need to be successful**

Transparency, a clear picture of our goal. Alone time to understand the material/task at hand in my own way, coupled with voice-to-voice collaboration to clarify issues or solve stubborn problems together.

**The best way to motivate me to do something**

Talking about how the end goal benefits the user’s life. Giving advance notice, clearly communicating the goal and the acceptance criteria.

**How to best communicate with me**

I like direct feedback in voice-to-voice conversation ideally. For simple matters, I prefer Slack messages, and for matters where clarifying questions are likely, calls. I prefer that people approach me with the acknowledgement that we are humans first, before our job titles. Everyone is worth the same, and that knowledge should color all interactions.

**What people misunderstand about me**

I’ve been told that I can seem aloof or uninterested upon first meeting, because I’m not quick to speak. It takes a lot for me to speak up in unfamiliar settings, with new people, and in large group settings. I can if absolutely necessary, but am most comfortable in small group settings and with a substantial period of shared proximity before speaking at length to or with anyone.

### Write your User Guide!

We will use Glitch to create our User Guide. Glitch is a website that makes it super easy to write and share code.

1. Go to http://glitch.com

2. Sign up using your email address and a password (make sure to choose a password you will remember)

3. Once you are signed in, click on "New Project" and select "hello-webpage"

4. This is your new Glitch project! Take some time to read the README.md file

![](images/glitch3.png)

5. Select the "index.html" file and DELETE EVERYTHING in it

6. Copy and paste the following into it (we will go over this code in a moment)

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My User Guide</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```

7. Click on the "Show" button

9. Go back to your Glitch project and add the following between the two `<body> </body>` lines

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My User Guide</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    Alex's User Guide

  </body>
</html>
```

10. Refresh your project show page. You should see:

11. Write the rest of your User Guide! Use Google to research how to make your user guide page

12. Share your User Guide link (should look like `some-words.glitch.me`) with everyone in Slack.
